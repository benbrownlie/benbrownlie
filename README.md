## About Me
Hello I'm Benjamin, I'm a Game Programmer and Narrative Designer. I've loved writing and game design for as long as I can remember which drew me to learn Game Programming at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.

## Projects


## Wait, Paws, Rewind.

Wait, Paws, Rewind is a game made by Osiris Studios, a team I was on during the major production period at my school. It is a movement based 3D platformer where the player, Tin, must make their way to the end of the level and escape. I developed all the movement based mechanics present in-game.

## Taverner.
![Taverner]()

Taverner is an arcade inspired drink serving game where the player must serve beers to an incoming wave of patrons. This was a game I worked on in the minor production phase of my first year at AIE.
I developed the Movement, Drink Serving, and Point Systems present in game.
